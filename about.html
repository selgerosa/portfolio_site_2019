       <p>Hello there, I'm Selina Gerosa. I'm a graphic and web designer based in NY. In 2018, I recieved a BFA in graphic design from Boston University, but my artistic journey began way before that.</p>
       <p>In middle school, I started keeping a sketchbook with me wherever I went (I still do). In high school I took an AP art class and learned about graphic design. I was immediately hooked. </p>
       <p>I have always loved problem solving and to me, that's what design is all about. It's the visual system that helps us navigate problems and find new solutions. While I still love visual art, now I spend most of my time designing websites, running social media campaigns, and generating brand campaigns.</p>
