       <h1>About</h1>
       <p>Hi there. My name’s Selina, but you can call me Sel. I’m a graphic designer based in Boston, Massachusetts, but thanks to the internet, I've worked with people from all over the world. I have a lot of eclectic interests (transitional serif fonts, bookbinding, and linguistics to name a few) but I thought I’d use this space to share a bit about my design philosophy and what I can do for you. After all, that’s why you’re here.</p>
       <p><strong>I look at design primarily as a way to solve problems.</strong> Some of the people I work with come to me with specific ideas on this. Maybe they need an extra hand <a href="digitalscience.html">managing a social media campaign</a>, or they want a logo that conveys just the right combination of “<a href="dorrie.html">cute but professional</a>.” Sometimes, the client and I start with the limitless possibilities of a blank white page, and we work together to articulate the vision. Wherever you are in the creative process, it’s my job to meet you there and deliver a product that accurately reflects your brand.</p>
       <p><strong>I am also committed to accessible, responsive design</strong>. By this I mean, my designs meet the needs of the differently-abled or marginalized people, such as those with limited vision. I aim to lift up those who are often overlooked in the digital world, and have made it my business to become an expert in inclusive design techniques. To see an example of these techniques in action, take a look at the <a href="rmk.html">Vedanta Temple website</a> project in my portfolio.</p>
       <p><strong>I work with all industries and business types, but I’m especially drawn to design projects that teach people things.</strong> So, if you’re an educator or a nonprofit, you’re definitely in the right place. Design is an incredibly effective engagement tool, and I live for projects that let me use my skills in this way, as I did for the <a href="continuum.html">Continuum Thesis Show</a>.</p>
       <p><strong>I’ll leave you with a confession:</strong> I can’t help but design. I need to design. So, asking me to dedicate myself 150% to your project is like asking me to breathe. Natural. Automatic. A pure joy.</p>
