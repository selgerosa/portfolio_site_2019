          <p> Dorrie Sacks, AKA LovelyDorrie is a <a href="https://dorriesstories.home.blog">writer</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcU3qwLQ4E4t1AeCCkZg5dw">internet host</a>, and voice actor. She commissioned me to design her a new business card, and this project quickly expanded into a full brand reimagining. We wanted to create a digital persona for her inspired by magical girl anime (like Sailor Moon and Madoka Magica), visual novel games (like Doki Literature Club), and soft goth + lolita fashion. Keeping these influences in mind, I illustrated the business card using pixel art and laid it out as if it were a video game title screen. The logo is inspired by shojo anime titles, street art tags, and ribbon.</p>
          <p>Dorrie herself, much like the magical girl anime that inspires her, combines cute aesthetics with scary, dark, and sometimes tragic themes in her work. Broken hearts are a perfect icon to represent that blend of cute+creepy. They appear throughout her brand persona, from the barrettes in her hair to the buckles in her shoes. I also just <em>had</em> to include her magical kitty sidekicks <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BpxLQw4hX_P/">Pepper</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLSblxprEQ/">Layla</a>.</p>

        <p> “Selina is an absolute joy to work with. When I commissioned them to create brand collateral for me, I knew I was in good hands because they care about getting every detail perfect. While working on the design, they sent me concept art and sketches so that I had a voice throughout the process. I am overjoyed with the results and I would absolutely work with them again.” &mdash; Dorrie</p>
